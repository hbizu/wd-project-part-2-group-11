# BMW Stand Web Project

This project was developed as part of a Web Development course assignment, in collaboration with two other students.

The goal was to create a website for a BMW stand using:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Bootstrap**

The site includes visual elements, layout structure, and styling to showcase BMW cars in a clean and responsive design.
