# 🚗 BMW Stand Web Project – Part 2

This repository contains **Part 2** of the BMW Stand website, developed as a **class assignment** for a Web Development course, in collaboration with two other students.

In **Part 1** we focused on **planning and design**, using **Figma** for designing the website layout and visual structure and **MySQL Workbench** for modeling the database schema and tables.

The goal of **Part 2** was to build a **static website** for a BMW stand using:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Bootstrap**
